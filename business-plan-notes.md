## Thesis

### Topic 
Social Listening for Social Good I: Analysis of Public’s Perception of Government’s Policies (Dell/MCIT Hackathon)

### about

- In a pursuit to enhance the quality of the governmental services to
citizens, monitoring and analyzing citizens and community feedback is
crucial to understand problems and areas of enhancements. To support
the national digital transformation toward smart government,
automating the process of monitoring, analysis and response is key to
achieve much better quality. Leveraging AI for real-time capturing,
analysis, and identification of citizens and community feedback can
enable intelligent automation based on text mining and NLP techniques.
The objective of this project is to collect such feedback from all potential
sources like official reviews, social media, citizen complaints among
others, then conduct deep analysis using NLP methods and graph
models to discover issues in a timely fashion. The focus is given to Arabic
language and Egyptian dialect to cope with the localization
requirements. One sector will be chosen as a focus of governmental
services for the project.

## steps


Great, focusing on transportation can be a good starting point for your project. Here are some additional steps you may want to consider:

Identify transportation-related feedback sources: Transportation-related feedback may come from sources such as social media, transportation apps, government websites, and citizen complaints. You may want to consider using data scraping tools to collect data from these sources.

Collect and organize transportation feedback data: With the transportation-related feedback sources identified, you can collect and organize the data into a database. You may want to consider using a data cleaning process to remove any irrelevant or duplicate feedback.

Apply NLP techniques to transportation feedback data: With the transportation feedback data collected and organized, you can apply NLP techniques to analyze the data. For example, you may want to use sentiment analysis to understand the overall sentiment of the feedback, topic modeling to identify key transportation-related topics, and named entity recognition to identify the key entities mentioned in the feedback (e.g. specific transportation services, routes, etc.).

Build a graph model for transportation-related issues: With the transportation-related feedback data analyzed, you can build a graph model to visualize the relationships between different transportation-related issues. This may help identify patterns and connections between different issues, which can help in formulating effective solutions.

Test and refine the model: Once the graph model has been created, it will need to be tested and refined to improve its accuracy and efficiency. This may involve adjusting the NLP techniques and graph model based on the results of the testing.

Provide recommendations to improve transportation services: With the transportation feedback data analyzed and the graph model created, you can provide recommendations to improve transportation services. For example, you may recommend improvements to specific routes, more frequent service, or changes to transportation infrastructure.

Overall, the steps outlined above can help you create a comprehensive analysis of transportation-related feedback, and provide actionable insights to improve transportation services for citizens in Egypt.





lets use twitter api with python for gathering the data
Using the Twitter API with Python is a great way to gather transportation-related feedback data from social media. Here are some steps to help you get started:

Create a Twitter Developer Account: To use the Twitter API, you will need to create a Twitter Developer Account. Go to the Twitter Developer site, create an account, and apply for a developer account.

Create a Twitter App: Once you have a Twitter Developer Account, you can create a Twitter app to access the API. To do this, go to the Twitter Developer Dashboard, create a new app, and generate a set of API keys and access tokens.

Install the Tweepy package: Tweepy is a Python package that makes it easy to access the Twitter API. You can install it using pip by running the command pip install tweepy in your command prompt.

Connect to the Twitter API: Using the API keys and access tokens generated in step 2, you can connect to the Twitter API




Set up a search query: With the Tweepy package, you can set up a search query to search for tweets containing keywords related to transportation in Egypt. For example, you might search for tweets containing keywords such as "traffic", "public transportation", "transportation service", "train", and "bus".

Collect tweets: Once you have set up your search query, you can use the Tweepy package to collect tweets matching your query. You can choose to collect tweets in real-time as they are posted, or you can collect tweets that have been posted in the past.

Process tweets using NLP techniques: With the tweets collected, you can use NLP techniques such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition to analyze the data. You can use Python libraries like NLTK or spaCy to perform these tasks.

Create a graph model: With the transportation-related feedback data analyzed, you can create a graph model to visualize the relationships between different transportation-related issues. This may help identify patterns and connections between different issues, which can help in formulating effective solutions.

Test and refine the model: Once the graph model has been created, it will need to be tested and refined to improve its accuracy and efficiency. This may involve adjusting the NLP techniques and graph model based on the results of the testing.

Provide recommendations to improve transportation services: With the transportation feedback data analyzed and the graph model created, you can provide recommendations to improve transportation services. For example, you may recommend improvements to specific routes, more frequent service, or changes to transportation infrastructure.

# Problem Plan

Frame the Problem and Look at the Big Picture
1. Define the objective in business terms.
2. How will your solution be used?
3. What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?
4. How should you frame this problem (supervised/unsupervised, online/offline,
etc.)?
5. How should performance be measured?
6. Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?

7. What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objec‐
tive?
8. What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?
9. Is human expertise available?
10. How would you solve the problem manually?
11. List the assumptions you (or others) have made so far.
12. Verify assumptions if possible.




## DATA Plan

1. List the data you need and how much you need.
2. Find and document where you can get that data.
3. Check how much space it will take.
4. Check legal obligations, and get authorization if necessary.
5. Get access authorizations.
6. Create a workspace (with enough storage space).
7. Get the data.
8. Convert the data to a format you can easily manipulate (without changing the
data itself).
9. Ensure sensitive information is deleted or protected (e.g., anonymized).
10. Check the size and type of data (time series, sample, geographical, etc.).
11. Sample a test set, put it aside, and never look at it (no data snooping!).


## Explore the Data
Note: try to get insights from a field expert for these steps.
1. Create a copy of the data for exploration (sampling it down to a manageable size
if necessary).
2. Create a Jupyter notebook to keep a record of your data exploration.
3. Study each attribute and its characteristics:
	• Name
	• Type (categorical, int/float, bounded/unbounded, text, structured, etc.)
	498
	|

	• % of missing values
	• Noisiness and type of noise (stochastic, outliers, rounding errors, etc.)
	• Possibly useful for the task?
	• Type of distribution (Gaussian, uniform, logarithmic, etc.)
4. For supervised learning tasks, identify the target attribute(s).
5. Visualize the data.
6. Study the correlations between attributes.
7. Study how you would solve the problem manually.
8. Identify the promising transformations you may want to apply.
9. Identify extra data that would be useful (go back to “Get the Data” on page 498).
10. Document what you have learned.




## Prepare the Data
Notes:
• Work on copies of the data (keep the original dataset intact).
• Write functions for all data transformations you apply, for five reasons:
— So you can easily prepare the data the next time you get a fresh dataset
— So you can apply these transformations in future projects
— To clean and prepare the test set
— To clean and prepare new data instances once your solution is live
— To make it easy to treat your preparation choices as hyperparameters
1. Data cleaning:
	• Fix or remove outliers (optional).
	• Fill in missing values (e.g., with zero, mean, median…) or drop their rows (or
	columns).
2. Feature selection (optional):
	• Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the task.
3. Feature engineering, where appropriate:
	• Discretize continuous features.

	• Decompose features (e.g., categorical, date/time, etc.).
	• Add promising transformations of features (e.g., log(x), sqrt(x), x^2, etc.).
	• Aggregate features into promising new features.
4. Feature scaling: standardize or normalize features.

One NLP use case problem that can be solved using hypothesis testing is the comparison of the accuracy of two language models for a specific task. For example, suppose we want to compare the accuracy of two language models, Model A and Model B, for sentiment classification of movie reviews.

Here's how we can use hypothesis testing to solve this problem:

Define the hypothesis: We need to define two hypotheses. The null hypothesis (H0) assumes that there is no difference between the accuracy of Model A and Model B for sentiment classification. The alternative hypothesis (HA) assumes that there is a significant difference between the accuracy of Model A and Model B for sentiment classification.
H0: The accuracy of Model A and Model B for sentiment classification is the same.

HA: The accuracy of Model A and Model B for sentiment classification is significantly different.

Choose a significance level: We need to choose a significance level (α) which represents the maximum probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. A common value for α is 0.05, which means that we are willing to accept a 5% chance of making a Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true).

Collect data: We need to collect data for sentiment classification using both Model A and Model B on the same set of movie reviews. We can split the dataset into training and testing sets, train each model on the training set, and evaluate the accuracy of each model on the testing set.

Calculate the test statistic: We can use a t-test to calculate the test statistic. The test statistic measures the difference between the means of the accuracy scores for Model A and Model B.

Calculate the p-value: The p-value represents the probability of observing the test statistic under the null hypothesis. We can use a t-distribution table or a statistical software to calculate the p-value.

Make a decision: We compare the p-value to the significance level. If the p-value is less than the significance level (p-value < α), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the accuracy of Model A and Model B for sentiment classification. If the p-value is greater than or equal to the significance level (p-value >= α), we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant difference between the accuracy of Model A and Model B for sentiment classification.

Note that there are several assumptions that need to be met for the t-test to be valid, such as normality of the data and equal variances between the two groups. These assumptions can be checked using statistical tests or plots.

In summary, hypothesis testing can be a powerful tool for comparing the accuracy of two language models for a specific NLP task. It allows us to make statistical inferences about the difference between the models and provides a framework for making decisions based on data.
