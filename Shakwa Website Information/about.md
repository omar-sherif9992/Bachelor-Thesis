### Purpose
- The purpose of Shakwa.eg is to provide a platform for citizens to voice their concerns and complaints regarding the services they receive from government entities. This includes complaints related to health services, education, transportation, utilities, and other government services. By providing a centralized platform for citizens to submit complaints, the government can monitor the quality of its services and take action to improve them.

## My Questions

## Data Acquistion

- The data of the user during the registeration process
- The data of the user in filling the complain data
- after customer send his complain , he will prompted to fill a survey.
- after customer problem resolved ,  he will prompted to fill a survey.



### Improvments

- Use data analytics: Data analytics could be used to analyze the complaints and feedback received through Shakwa.eg and social media platforms. This would help the government to identify key issues and trends and allocate resources more effectively.

- Implement a rewards system: A rewards system could be implemented to incentivize citizens to submit complaints and feedback. This could include rewards such as discounts on government services or other incentives that encourage citizens to engage with the government.

- Enhancing the user interface: The website could be made more user-friendly and accessible for users, particularly those who may not have limited access to the internet.

### Improvments from Machine Learning Side

1- Predictive analytics (Time-series analysis): Machine learning algorithms could be used to predict the likelihood of certain complaints or issues arising in the future. This would allow the government to proactively address issues before they become major problems.

2-Fraud detection: Machine learning algorithms could be used to detect fraudulent complaints and feedback received through Shakwa.eg. This would help to ensure that the platform is being used appropriately and that the government is not wasting resources on fraudulent claims.


3- Citizen complain severity : rank customer complains to respond faster .

4- Recommendation systems to (Employees) : Machine learning algorithms could be used to develop recommendation systems that suggest solutions or interventions based on the type of complaint or feedback received. This could help the government to provide targeted solutions that are more likely to be effective based on previous complaints and their responding solutions . 

5- Automatic response generation to (clients) : use machine learning algorithms to recommend specific solutions or interventions based on the type of complaint or feedback a user has submitted in the past

6- Chatbots (unknown to me yet): Machine learning algorithms could be used to develop chatbots that can automatically respond to common complaints and feedback received through Shakwa.eg.

7- Information Extraction & Reformating & Named Entity Recognition : automatically identify and extract key entities from user submissions, such as the name of a government agency, the location of the complaint, or the type of issue being reported. This information can then be used to automatically categorize and prioritize incoming complaints and feedback, and route them to the appropriate department or team for resolution

8- Topic modeling : The most prominent sectors about which complaints and appeals were received , it will be on both sides, why? To give accurate measurments
	- Client Side : while client writes his or her complaints , topic modeling will occur on the text to generate topics and client will say it is correct or not or based on category selection(easier) .
	- Employee side : the complaints will have Hashtags(that where modeled from client side) for easier filtraton and charts about trending topics  

9- Text Summarization : Summarize customer complaints to get a quick brief of what problem is talking about .


10- Message clssification(whether complain or normal messge)

11- text classifier : to classify reports into what classification

12- Geospatial analysis: Machine learning algorithms could be used to analyze location-based data to identify patterns or trends in complaints and feedback received from different geographic regions. This could help the government to develop interventions that are tailored to the needs of specific communities or regions.

13- Give Documents recommendations to be provided based on the complaint: this by reading the citizen complaint and comparing it to previous complaints where they required some essential documents to proceed with his or her request , this will increase response time for citizen and throughput for employee.

14- Information extraction using NLP and Computer Vision for documents will be very hard and time-consuming challenge and will take long time to adapt this feature

15- Choose a ticketing system: There are many different ticketing systems available, both open source and proprietary, that you could use for Shakwa.eg. Some popular options include JIRA, Zendesk, and Freshdesk. Choose a ticketing system that is scalable, reliable, and user-friendly.
	- [Demo](https://www.freshworks.com/freshdesk/demo-request/)
	- Omnichannel customer service
	- Offer conversational support across all digital channels
	- Powerful agent desktop
	- Empower your team with a unified view for contextual collaboration
	- Helpdesk AI & automation
	- Solve inquiries rapidly with AI and workflow automation
	- Integrations with business apps
	- Scale support operations and create an ecosystem of interoperability	- 

16 - Speech recognition: Machine learning algorithms could be used to transcribe and analyze recorded complaints or feedback received through call centers or other communication channels. This could help the government to identify common issues or concerns that may not be evident through written communication channels.

17- Add success rate of the complaints to be proceeded : this by analyzing the previous requests of same type to shift the focus of the employees to solve it first instead of solving weaker success rates first.

18- sentiment analysis : 
	Analyze the sentiment of the complaints to identify the emotions and opinions expressed by 				citizens. This can help understand citizens' attitudes towards different government services and policies.
	- citizen report : to know if its positive or negative to reflect back
	- employees responds : to know if the responds were positve and not aggressive

19- Tracking system: Develop a tracking system that allows citizens to track the status of their complaints. This can help in improving transparency and building trust among citizens.

20- Automated response (Time series analysis): Develop an automated response system that acknowledges receipt of the complaint and provides an estimated timeframe for resolution. This can help in reducing the anxiety of citizens and improve their confidence in the system.

21- Language translation: Implement NLP algorithms to automatically translate complaints into different languages, making it easier for non-native speakers to communicate with the government.

22- Social media analysis: Use NLP algorithms to monitor social media platforms for complaints and feedback related to government services and policies. This can help the government identify emerging issues and respond more quickly to citizen concerns.


23-Intent recognition: Use NLP algorithms to identify the underlying intent behind a citizen's complaint, such as a request for information, a request for action, or a request for feedback. This can help the government provide more targeted and personalized responses.

24- Contextual understanding: Use NLP algorithms to better understand the context in which a citizen's complaint was made, such as their location, time of day, or previous interactions with the government. This can help the government provide more relevant and useful responses.

25-Interactive voice response (IVR)(AMAZON): Implement an IVR system that uses NLP algorithms to understand spoken complaints and provide automated responses. This can help reduce response time and improve the overall user experience.


26- Cross-domain analysis: Use NLP algorithms to analyze complaints across different domains, such as healthcare, transportation, and education, allowing the government to identify systemic issues and take a more holistic approach to problem-solving.
	- example: consider a citizen complaint about the quality of public transportation in a particular city. By analyzing data from different domains, such as transportation, healthcare, and education, the government can identify potential root causes of the issue. Perhaps the transportation system is overcrowded due to population growth, leading to increased stress and health problems among citizens who rely on public transit. Or maybe there is a lack of access to education and job opportunities in certain areas, leading to increased demand for public transit and congestion.
	
28- grouping Similar with neartime previous complains : this will help in reducing number of complaints on the same problem

#### How Topic modeling  ? 
Collect the data: You will need to gather the text data from the website, which may involve web scraping or using an API to extract the data. You may also need to clean and preprocess the data to remove irrelevant information such as HTML tags, stopwords, and punctuation.

Tokenize the text: Next, you need to split the text into individual words or phrases, which is called tokenization. You can use a tokenizer such as NLTK or spaCy to perform this task.

Create a document-term matrix: The document-term matrix is a table that represents the frequency of words in each document. You can create this matrix using a tool such as CountVectorizer or TF-IDF Vectorizer in Python.

Perform topic modeling: There are several methods for topic modeling, but one of the most commonly used algorithms is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). You can use libraries such as Gensim or Scikit-Learn in Python to implement LDA.

Evaluate the results: After running the topic modeling algorithm, you should evaluate the results to ensure that the topics generated are coherent and meaningful. This may involve manually inspecting the top words in each topic or using metrics such as coherence score to measure the quality of the topics.

Visualize the results: Finally, you can use visualization tools such as pyLDAvis to create interactive visualizations of the topics and their relationships.
